# Executive Summary: MCP-Powered Accessibility AI

## Product Vision
The Shaft Foundation's Accessibility AI leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to orchestrate specialized AI agents that transform inaccessible visual web content into rich, interactive experiences for vision impaired users.

## The Problem We Solve

### Current State
- **45+ minutes** for vision impaired users to understand complex visual content
- **70% of websites** fail basic accessibility requirements
- **30% information loss** when using traditional screen readers
- **$4.2B projected lost revenue** from inaccessible AI agent interactions by 2025

### Our Solution
Using MCP protocol to coordinate multiple AI agents, we provide:
- **< 10 minute comprehension** of complex visual content
- **95% information capture** from images, charts, and infographics
- **Real-time interaction** with previously inaccessible content
- **100% WCAG AAA compliance** for enhanced content

## Target User: Sarah's Story

**Sarah Chen**, a product manager with 5% vision, represents our primary user persona:
- Uses NVDA screen reader and ZoomText magnification
- Needs to analyze competitor comparison charts for quarterly planning
- Currently struggles with visual content that only announces "Image" or "Chart"
- Loses critical business insights due to inaccessible data visualizations
