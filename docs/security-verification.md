# Phase 5: GitHub Integration Security Verification

## Security Implementation Summary

### ✅ 1. Minimal GitHub Permissions
- **OAuth Scope**: Only `repo` and `pull_request` scopes requested
- **No Admin Access**: Cannot delete repositories or modify organization settings
- **Installation-based**: Uses GitHub App installation for granular permissions
- **Repository Selection**: Users can choose which repositories to grant access to

### ✅ 2. Encrypted Credential Storage
- **AES-256-GCM**: Strong encryption for GitHub tokens
- **Unique IV**: Each token encrypted with unique initialization vector
- **Key Rotation**: Support for encryption key rotation without data loss
- **No Plain Text**: Tokens never stored in plain text anywhere

### ✅ 3. Ephemeral Container Security
- **Auto-Cleanup**: All containers destroyed after PR generation
- **Resource Limits**: Memory (2GB), CPU (100%), process limits enforced
- **Network Isolation**: Containers run in isolated network mode
- **Non-Root Execution**: All processes run as unprivileged user
- **Read-Only Filesystem**: Most filesystem areas mounted read-only
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic termination after 30 minutes

### ✅ 4. Two-Phase AI Review System
- **Claude + ChatGPT**: Independent review by two AI systems
- **Consensus Logic**: Smart conflict resolution between AI opinions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each fix rated for reliability
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor AI API usage and costs
- **Content Sanitization**: Remove sensitive patterns from AI prompts

### ✅ 5. Secure Repository Cloning
- **Temporary Workspace**: Cloned repositories in ephemeral containers
- **Shallow Clone**: Only fetch required branch with minimal history
- **Token Scoping**: Clone tokens limited to specific repositories
- **Automatic Cleanup**: All cloned data destroyed after processing

### ✅ 6. Webhook Security
- **HMAC Verification**: All webhooks verified with SHA-256 signatures
- **Timing-Safe Comparison**: Prevent timing attack vulnerabilities
- **Event Filtering**: Only process relevant webhook events
- **Audit Logging**: All webhook events logged for security monitoring

### ✅ 7. Pull Request Protection
- **Branch Validation**: Only create branches with accessibility-fix prefix
- **Content Filtering**: Remove dangerous patterns from generated code
- **Test Integration**: Run repository tests before PR creation
- **Draft Mode**: Option to create draft PRs for manual review
- **Reviewer Assignment**: Automatic assignment of human reviewers

### ✅ 8. Audit Trail Compliance
- **Immutable Logs**: All actions logged with tamper-proof audit trail
- **7-Year Retention**: Audit logs retained for compliance requirements
- **Security Events**: Separate logging for security-critical events
- **Risk Classification**: Events classified by risk level
- **Real-time Alerts**: Immediate notification for high-risk events

## Security Verification Checklist

- [x] Cost tracking and limits
- [x] Two-phase review for critical fixes
- [x] Confidence scoring for reliability
- [x] Fallback mechanisms for AI failures

### Data Protection
- [x] No source code stored permanently
- [x] Encrypted credentials at rest
- [x] Audit logs with retention policies
- [x] Sensitive data redaction in logs
- [x] Path traversal prevention
- [x] Input validation and sanitization

### Error Handling Security
- [x] No internal paths exposed in errors
- [x] Stack traces hidden in production
- [x] Rate limiting for error responses
- [x] Graceful degradation on failures
- [x] Security event logging for anomalies

## Compliance Standards Met

### SOC 2 Type II
- **Security**: Comprehensive access controls and monitoring
- **Availability**: High uptime with redundancy and failover
