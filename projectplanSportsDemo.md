# AI Accessibility Scanner - Test-Driven Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan follows a test-driven development approach where we write tests first, then implement features to make them pass. Every phase includes deployment verification to ensure the system works end-to-end.

## Technology Decisions

- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with built-in auth, realtime, and REST API)
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel (auto-deploy on commit, preview deployments)
- **Backend Hosting**: Railway (auto-scaling, load balancing, simple deployment)
- **Queue/Cache**: Upstash Redis (serverless, scales automatically)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (test on PR, deploy on merge)
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Railway metrics
