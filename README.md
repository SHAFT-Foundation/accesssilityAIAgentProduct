# AI Accessibility Scanner - Automated WCAG Compliance with PR Fixes

https://accessibility-ai-scanner.vercel.app/

> As AI agents begin to power everything from productivity tools to financial services, those built with full accessibility and inclusion by design aren't just ethically aligned‚Äîthey are more interoperable, more likely to be adopted, and more trusted in the emerging networks of AI agents that interact, evaluate, and select one another.
> In this new paradigm, accessibility isn't a feature‚Äîit's a network advantage.

## We Don't Just Find Accessibility Issues. We Fix Them.

The only accessibility tool that submits PRs with actual code fixes. Our AI agents scan your site, write the fix, test it, and submit a PR. You just review and merge.

pm2 start npm --name "api" -- start

# Workers
pm2 start npm --name "scan-worker" -- run worker:scan
pm2 start npm --name "pr-worker" -- run worker:pr
pm2 start npm --name "email-worker" -- run worker:email

# Web
pm2 start npm --name "web" -- start
```

### Testing

```

### Security Considerations

- All source code processing happens in ephemeral containers
- We never store your source code - only PR diffs
- SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure
- End-to-end encryption for all data in transit
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `http://localhost:4000/docs` when running locally.
